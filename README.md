# Devitzer

Hello, I am Devitzer! I like to make small projects that are more for fun than useful.
Each project I make is something new I have never worked on before!

I am working on a programming language called Obsidian! It's a very easy to learn language with documentation [here!](https://obsidian.geodax.ca/)

Yes, I gave my own respository a license ðŸ˜œ
