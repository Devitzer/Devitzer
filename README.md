# Devitzer

Hello, I am Devitzer! I like to make small projects that are more for fun than useful.
Each project I make is something new I have never worked on before!

I am working on a programming language called CitrineScript! It's main goal is to expand on JavaScripts simple syntax and make it even simpler.

Yes, I gave my own respository a license ðŸ˜œ
